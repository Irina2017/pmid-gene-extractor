To inform the future development of an acceptable and relevant intervention for women with severe fear of childbirth, primary objectives were to examine: (1) pregnant women&#8217;s experiences of and preferences for support and (2) barriers and facilitators to help-seeking. Secondary objectives were to examine if there are any differences based on pregnant women&#8217;s parity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Pregnant women with a severe fear of childbirth in Sweden completed an online cross-sectional survey between February and September 2022. Severe fear of childbirth was measured using the fear of childbirth scale.

A contiguous approach to integration was adopted with qualitative and quantitative findings reported separately.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">In total, 609 participants, 364 nulliparous and 245 parous women, had severe fear of childbirth. The main category &#8220;A twisting road to walk towards receiving support for fear of childbirth&#8221; was explored and described by the generic categories: <italic toggle="yes">Longing for support</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Struggling to ask for support</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Facilitating aspects of seeking support</italic>. Over half (63.5%), of pregnant women without planned or ongoing treatment, wanted support for fear of childbirth. Most (60.2%) pregnant women with ongoing or completed fear of childbirth treatment regarded the treatment as less helpful or not at all helpful. If fear of childbirth treatment was not planned, 35.8% of women would have liked to have received treatment. Barriers to help seeking included stigma surrounding fear of childbirth, previous negative experiences with healthcare contacts, fear of not being believed, fear of not being listened to, and discomfort of having to face their fears. Facilitators to help seeking included receiving respectful professional support that was easily available, flexible, and close to home.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Most pregnant women with severe fear of childbirth felt unsupported during pregnancy.

Three steps were followed to analyse the text (1) preparation, (2) organizing and (3) reporting. Two authors (CNR and MJ) read the free-text responses to gain an overall understanding of the free-text responses. Next, CNR and MJ identified condensed meaning units (e.g., text sharing a common meaning) and performed line-by-line coding separately. CNR reviewed initial meaning units and coding, with variations discussed by CNR and MJ. Subsequently, CNR and MJ sorted codes into three generic categories, including eight sub-categories that described the main category (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Identified categories were discussed by CNR and MJ to ensure mutual exclusivity and a credible foundation in data. Descriptions of main category, generic categories and sub-categories were prepared by CNR and MJ, with other co-authors performing peer examination of written descriptions. Trustworthiness was also established via independent coding by CNR and MJ and record keeping. To strengthen results, quotations from free text responses are presented, with quotations presented only with the women&#180;s parity and age, to preserve confidentiality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Data integration</title><p id="Par25">A contiguous approach to data integration was adopted with qualitative and quantitative findings reported separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].

To better prepare for childbirth, women wanted help to design a written birth plan in early pregnancy including wishes concerning mode of birth, length of hospital stay after the birth, and that the plan is respected, rather than questioned and negotiated by professionals.

Some women did not take their own fear seriously, believing others to have more to be afraid of to be in more need of more help. These women expressed not wanting to bother and burden professionals and hoped the fear would disappear by itself.

One nulliparous woman, aged 27, described it as: <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t work the rest of the day after the counselling support and got a disturbed night&#8217;s sleep &#8230; the whole thing got even more traumatic&#8221;.</italic> Another nulliparous woman, aged 33, said: &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">I felt resignation when I received the support offered, I got the notion that there is nothing they can help me with&#8221;.</italic></p><p id="Par60">Some women felt stigmatised by professionals, and perceived their fear to have been turned into a clinical diagnosis, creating a disadvantage in &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">power</italic>&#8221;, alongside misconceptions and preconceived notions on perinatal mental health and previous mental illness before childbirth. One nulliparous woman, aged 31, reported:<disp-quote><p id="Par61"><italic toggle="yes">My history with anorexia and anxiety often comes into focus.</italic> [I have this] <italic toggle="yes">feeling that everything comes down to making a diagnosis and it scares me.

For example, being able to choose between digitally-based meetings with lectures, and webinars was regarded as important. Digital solutions were considered to make it easier to seek help due to saving time on transportation and facilitating anonymity. Some women preferred to be offered physical meetings and to be allowed to visit the labour ward during pregnancy.

I&#8217;m afraid of feeling or appearing silly, immature and not ready to be a parent if I express fear of childbirth.</italic></p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par67">Women considered being offered and encouraged to receive support before (e.g., for women with a previous traumatic birth experience) or in early pregnancy as ways to facilitate help-seeking. Women also wanted to be able to receive support for fear of childbirth without having to be referred for consultation. One parous woman aged 34 noted:<disp-quote><p id="Par68"><italic toggle="yes">If I had received the slightest help before I got pregnant, it would have felt easier to receive help during the pregnancy. I would have also had greater confidence that the maternity care genuinely wanted to help me based on my circumstances.</italic></p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par69"><italic toggle="yes">Respectful evidence-based support</italic> concerns women expressing being offered respectful evidence-based support as a way to facilitate seeking help for their fear. Women wanted competent antenatal care professionals with knowledge and training in mental health, childbirth complications, and available support and treatment options. One nulliparous woman aged 30 described:<disp-quote><p id="Par70"><italic toggle="yes">Finally, I spoke to a psychologist who was also trained and had worked as a midwife for many years. I felt that she could guide me and to deal with my feelings.

Women wanted to be listened to, taken seriously, and not rejected, belittled, put down, ignored, trivialized, or questioned by professionals. One parous woman, aged 36, asked for: <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;Professionals that have enough time to provide support, and offer suitable therapists who instill confidence&#8221;</italic>.</p><p id="Par72">It was expressed by women that having the right to decide over one&#8217;s own body and to choose the mode of birth was important also. Women did not want to receive coercive treatment and motivational talks for their fear with the aim of forcing women to give birth vaginally. One nulliparous woman aged 31 wrote: &#8220;[It] <italic toggle="yes">must be easier to get a caesarian section in case of severe fear of childbirth.</italic> [It is] <italic toggle="yes">unreasonable to put patients through months of extreme anxiety&#8221;.</italic></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par73">Around two-thirds (63%) of women with fear of childbirth had not planned nor had received any supportive psychological treatment for fear of childbirth. Of those who had received support, 60% reported that the support received was less helpful or not helpful at all. Pregnant women preferred to receive individual-based support provided by antenatal healthcare professionals with sufficient mental health knowledge. Barriers to seeking support included a fear of not being listened to, or believed in by others, the discomfort of having to face their own fears, previous negative healthcare contacts, and the general stigma surrounding fear of childbirth. Facilitators to seeking support included respectful evidence-based support that was easily available, flexible, and close to home.</p><sec id="Sec33"><title>Support for fear of childbirth</title><p id="Par74">Swedish standard antenatal care states that women with fear of childbirth should be offered support via counselling with a midwife [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Our findings suggest not all pregnant women with severe fear of childbirth who had wanted psychological treatment actually received it. Some antenatal clinics may not support all pregnant women with a severe fear of childbirth, given the quality of clinical care and resources differs throughout Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par75">Our findings indicate that parous women were more likely to receive a planned treatment for fear of childbirth than nulliparous women. This difference may partly be because parous women, especially those who had a complicated birth or negative birth experience, such as a caesarean section [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], are routinely invited to review their records with a physician or a midwife and offered a plan of care for the next birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis suggests nulliparous and parous women have similar levels of fear, but have fear for different reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]; therefore, they may have different support needs. Qualitative findings suggested nulliparous women wanted support to prepare for childbirth via information and counselling with an individual birthing plan to help make them feel safe. This finding is in line with other research with nulliparous women, suggesting support may need to focus on handling the unknown and upcoming birth, receiving information on different childbirth scenarios, and injury prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par76">Importantly, 60% of the women who received support for fear of childbirth considered it less helpful or not helpful at all. Whilst Swedish research suggested women were satisfied with counselling, effects on fear, anxiety, and requests for a caesarean section have not been shown to differ from those not receiving supportive counselling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Non-pharmacological interventions have been found to reduce fear of childbirth; however, effects were not clinically meaningful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par77">Importantly, 45% of pregnant women with severe fear of childbirth in the present study did not know if they wanted to receive psychological treatment. Previous research suggests pregnant women may believe they can manage their fear by not talking to others about it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and subsequently, refrain from participating in antenatal parental classes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Parous women may adopt additional avoidant coping strategies such as blocking memories of previous traumatic childbirth experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and avoid discussing their upcoming birth with healthcare professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Barriers to help-seeking for childbirth fear</title><p id="Par78">Barriers to help-seeking included fear of not being listened to, or believed in by others. Other research suggests women with fear of childbirth experience a lack of understanding from healthcare professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], with their birthing wishes disregarded in favour for standardised procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Pregnant women with fear of childbirth have described the importance of being treated by a competent midwife during counselling e.g., who is calm, skilled, whom acknowledges and listens to the women&#180;s thoughts and feelings, thus enhancing a sense of trust and security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, our findings suggest previous negative healthcare contacts were a barrier to help-seeking. During pregnancy, women in Sweden have regular contact with an antenatal care midwife providing opportunities for the woman-midwife team to work with any previous negative healthcare experiences, and create new positive experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Research has found parous women to be more likely to regard previous negative healthcare experiences as a barrier in seeking help for fear of childbirth, compared to nulliparous women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p id="Par79">Another barrier identified was stigma. Stigma has been found to be a barrier to the implementation of perinatal mental health policy and practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Feelings of isolation, guilt, and shame, due to perceived stigma have been reported by women with fear of childbirth in other research, with women feeling unable to talk about their fears with their partners or midwives since pregnancy is generally seen as a time of happiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Gendered norms and ideals about how a pregnant woman, or a woman in labour, should feel, think, and act, impact both the way healthcare professionals treat women and the way women express and behave themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and act as barriers to help-seeking.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Facilitators in help-seeking for childbirth fear</title><p id="Par80">Facilitators to help-seeking include the provision respectful evidence-based support that is easily available, flexible, and close to home. Examples of flexible solutions include digital self-help interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and healthcare professionals being able to provide support via telephone or video conversations, allowing care at a distance and facilitating access for women who have little time for physical visits e.g., full-time jobs and childcare responsibilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Interventions to overcome stigma for women with fear of childbirth may be important to develop, with such interventions found to be effective for reducing stigma in relation to perinatal depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and may be helpful to enhance help-seeking in the population.</p><p id="Par81">Results also suggest a need for midwives to be knowledgeable in psychological treatment for fear of childbirth, with women needing compassionate, respectful, and supportive care by healthcare professionals, regardless of fear and birthing preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Facilitators to the effective implementation of perinatal mental health policy and practice include the provision of flexible women-centered services, delivered by knowledgeable healthcare professionals working for continuity of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The quality of the healthcare-provider relationship, healthcare professionals normalising perinatal mental health problems, knowing that help is available, and understanding different treatment options have been found to be facilitators to mental health screening among pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par82">Overall, results suggest a need for more research to develop and evaluate evidence-based psychological interventions for women with severe fear of childbirth that are tailored to women&#180;s needs and preferences. Evidence suggests midwife-led continuity of care models with women supported throughout the childbirth period are beneficial for women with fear of childbirth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Policy makers need to consider Swedish systems of care and allow evidence-based care that optimises a woman&#180;s chance of forming a trusting relationship with healthcare providers. However, the implementation of perinatal mental health policy and practice is complex and varied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and lack of training and knowledge of healthcare professionals, complex referral pathways, and lack of trusting relationships between the woman and healthcare providers have been found to be barriers to effective implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Strengths and the limitations</title><p id="Par83">This study provides a comprehensive overview of the experiences of and preferences for support, barriers and facilitators to help-seeking, and it also examines differences based on pregnant women&#8217;s parity. Another strength is the relatively large sample size and that all counties in Sweden are represented. Despite these strengths, the study has several limitations. Recruitment relied on convenience sampling, and based on sample characteristics, our sample only represents Swedish-speaking women. Thus, findings may not be generalizable to non-Swedish-speaking women in Sweden. Due to the online survey format women needed to have some level of digital literacy to complete the survey which may have impacted the transferability of findings. Qualitative data consisted of free-text responses that varied in length and depth. However, the data still provided important insights into the experiences of women with severe fear of childbirth, their needs, and perceived barriers and facilitators to help-seeking.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec37" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par84">This is among the first studies in Sweden to provide a comprehensive overview of the experiences of and preferences for support of pregnant women with severe fear of childbirth and barriers and facilitators to help-seeking, and to examine differences based on pregnant women&#8217;s parity. Results indicate not all women with severe fear of childbirth receive support, and many who do receive support regard it as unhelpful. Developing a more comprehensive understanding of experiences and preferences for support, alongside barriers and facilitating for help-seeking, including taking into consideration differences based on women&#180;s parity, are important first steps to inform the development of more acceptable,, relevant, and effective support for women with severe fear of childbirth. Findings highlight the importance of developing accessible, flexible, and individualised support, delivered by trained professionals with an empathetic and respectful attitude, enabling pregnant women to sustain their autonomy during pregnancy and childbirth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="Sec38"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
